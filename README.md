I was looking for a way to quickly get a color palette into procreate from an image. Turns out there wasn't one. So allow me to introduce [Swatcher](https://swatcher.app), a bare-bones web-app that lets you upload an image, generate color palettes, and share them, all without leaving your iPad.

Pretty sweet, huh? (I'd like to think so.)

See an issue? Tag it. I want it fixed just as much as you do.

Need a feature? Open an issue. I want to make this as best as I can.
